Hi nice to meet you all, I'm Hongseok \[[/hoŋsʰʌk̚/](assets/audio/hongseok.mp3)\]. I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence at University of California, San Diego in 2023 Fall.

Before embarking an academic journey, I worked at [Deeply Inc.](https://deeplyinc.com) as an AI research engineer with [Myeonghoon Ryu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myeonghoon-ryu-319b1b12a/). we thrived to add meaning to omnipresent sound. Also, I completed my undergradute degree at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp) in information and industrial engineering.
