Hi nice to meet you all, I'm Hongseok \[[/hoŋsʰʌk̚/](assets/audio/hongseok.wav)\].  I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Qualcomm, where I work on advancing speech technology as part of the Speech R&D team.

I recently earned my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of California, San Diego, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I worked at [Deeply Inc.](https://deeplyinc.com) as an AI Research Engineer, where we strived to add meaning to omnipresent sound through research and development in speech and audio AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), majoring in Information and Industrial Engineering.
